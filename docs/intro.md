# Welcome üéâ

Hi everyone, welcome to CS1101S Studio! In each weekly 2-hour-long studio session, we will be looking at questions that reinforce important concepts covered in lectures and missions/quests. We will start off with a **brief recap of lecture content** (if time permits) and move on to the **weekly studio sheets**. In addition to that, there will also be extra questions, in the form of **in-class studio sheets**, that you will be attempting together with your friends in the same studio!

_I know what you are thinking_ but rest assured, studios are more fun than that because you will also have the chance to work on **Sumo-Bot** üëä as one studio group.

## Studio Materials

As you can see on the sidebar to your ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, there are individual pages for each studio where you can find the **slides**, and most importantly, a collection of questions/content (or interesting/cool things) that were discussed in the respective studios. The link to download in-class studio sheets are also there.

:::caution
Since these are **in-class** studio sheets, the link will be active only during studio sessions.

Past year papers for each assessment/exam will be made available once it's closer to the actual date of the test. Solutions will be available once it's **much** closer to the actual test, this is so that you can have time to think about your answers before referring to the suggested solutions.
