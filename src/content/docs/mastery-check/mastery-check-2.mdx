## Topics Tested

1. Environment model
2. Memoization
3. Streams

> Topics from [Mastery Check 1](/mastery-check/mastery-check-1#topics-tested) will definitely be talked about as well!

## What's going to happen?

**You know the [drill](/mastery-check/mastery-check-1#whats-going-to-happen)**

## Environment Model 🌲

```javascript
function hoo(s) {
  return is_null(s) ? 0 : head(s) + hoo(stream_tail(s));
}

function foo(lst) {
  let x = 43;

  function boo(x) {
    x = x + 1;
    return x + x;
  }

  function hoo(y) {
    return x + y;
  }

  return is_null(lst) ? null : pair(boo(hoo(head(lst))), () => foo(tail(lst)));
}

const ray = foo(list(1, 2, 3, 4));
hoo(ray);
```

### Questions

_Exclude the global environment for the questions below_

1. How many **frames** are created in the execution of the program?
2. How many **functions objects** are created in the execution of the program?
3. How many **`pairs`** are created in the execution of the program?

## Memoization 🧠

With the knowledge of memoization, it is time we show some love to `tower_of_hanoi` introduced in [Studio 4](/studios/studio-04#tower-of-hanoi).

### Q1: Can `tower_of_hanoi` be memoized?

Explain why you can/cannot memoize the `tower_of_hanoi` function?

### Q2: Implement `memoized_tower_of_hanoi`

If your answer to Q1 is a _yes_, implement a memoized version of the function `tower_of_hanoi`:

```javascript
// Returns the number of moves needed to move n discs from `from` -> `to`
function memoized_tower_of_hanoi(n, from, to, spare) {
  // YOUR SOLUTION HERE
}

// This should run ⚡️ fast
memoized_tower_of_hanoi(100, 1, 3, 2);
```

## Streams 🌊

Streams make use of the concept of laziness and deplayed operations. This is particularly helpful for computing long and expensive sequences, since we are adhering to the principle of _"evaluating it only when I need it"_.

Recall the `permutations` function that was introduced in [Studio 6](/studios/studio-06). No doubt it is a (_very_) long and expensive process. Therefore, now that we are equipped with the knowledge of **streams**, we can make a **stream of permutations** and use laziness to our advantage.

### Q1: Implement `stream_permutations`

Implement the function `stream_permutations` that takes in a **finite** stream of elements and returns **a stream of streams**. This means that each possible permutation is represented by a stream, stored in a (outer) stream 😅

> The order of permutations is up to you, as long you have all of them in your stream.

```javascript
// Function Signature (assume elements are int)
// Stream[Int] -> Stream[Stream[Int]]
function stream_permutations(s) {
  // YOUR SOLUTION HERE
}

const elements = list(1, 2, 3);
const elements_stream = list_to_stream(elements);
const permutations = stream_permutations(elements_stream);

const first_permutations = eval_stream(head(permutations), 3); // [X, [Y, [Z, null]]]
```

:::note
Useful functions:

1. `list_to_stream` (pre-declared)
2. `stream_remove` (pre-declared)
3. `stream_append_pickle` (Studio 11 In-class)

### Q2: `eval_stream_of_streams`

Implement the function `eval_stream_of_streams` to evaluate a stream of streams. The behavior should be similar to `eval_stream`, but since we are dealing with stream of streams, our function signature would be a little different:

```javascript
// n: force evaluate the first n elements of ss
// m: force evaluate the first m elements in each of n elements of ss
function eval_stream_of_streams(ss, n, m) {
  // YOUR SOLUTION HERE
}

const elements = list(1, 2, 3);
const elements_stream = list_to_stream(elements);
const permutations = stream_permutations(elements_stream);

// Returns you all the permutations of list(1,2,3) in the form of List[List[int]]
// Since we know the number of permutations = 3! = 6
// and each permutations has length = 3
eval_stream_of_streams(permutations, 6, 3);
```
